Ideas & Resources

My name is Brandon Goss, I am 23 years old and have been working as a Mechanical Engineer since June 2016. I am here to develop a portfolio to display my computer programming abilities, tracking from this point (very little coding experience), to hopefully a new career in software development and engineering.
